# ATM terminal Python program

# code logic:

# 1. customers should be able to create ATM pins 
#     the pins should be of 4 digits and digits only
# 2. customers should be able to login only with their created pin and nothing else 

# 3. customers should be able to: 

#     * see their balances
#     * withdraw
#     * deposit
#     *exit

# 4. we should use functions to make our code more readable
